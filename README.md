# Daily Fantasy Score Predictor


Daily Fantasy is a huge emerging market that imbues the sports world with statistics and gaming. With FanDuel's 275 million dollar Series E and DraftKings 300 million dollar Series D, the two startups have crossed the defining valuation of one billion dollars a piece.


Relatively new, daily fantasy was started in 2009 by FanDuel as an alternative to season-long fantasy sports provided by Yahoo and CBS. In this project, we will explore different techniques to optimize lineups and attempt to implement a machine learning technique that can compete against humanst. The implications of such an algorithm is massive; it could be used for either highly accurate salary assignments by a fantasy site or arbitrage for personal gain.
